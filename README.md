## Introduction
SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.

This Analysis aimed to check whether SAT is a fair test or not. For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.
